# My Awesome Website Project

This project is a static website inspired by the design of societies.io.
It's built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and intended for deployment on Vercel.

## Project Structure

-   `/public`: Contains all static assets and HTML files served to the browser.
    -   `/public/css`: Stylesheets.
    -   `/public/js`: JavaScript files.
    -   `/public/images`: Image assets (you'll create this folder when you add images).
-   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files by Git.
-   `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `public/index.html` directly in your browser to view the site.
    (For a better development experience with live reload, consider using a simple live server extension in your code editor, or `npx live-server public`).

## Deployment

This site is configured for easy deployment via Vercel. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and set the "Output Directory" to `public` (or ensure Vercel correctly auto-detects it).
